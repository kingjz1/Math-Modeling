The file 'Integrate_Fire_Poisson_Input.m' simulates and plots the firing behavior of a neuron based on the Integrate and Fire model with an input current given by a Poisson process.

The file 'firing_rate_relations.m' tries to find a relationship between the firing rate of the simulated neuron and the Poisson process rate & the input current strength.
